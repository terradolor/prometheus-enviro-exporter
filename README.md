## Features

* Reading values from Raspberry Pi [Pimoroni Enviro or Enviro+ (with PM)](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/enviro) sensor
  * All sensors are supported except: MEMS microphone, ADS1015 analog to digital converter
  * Display is not used and free for other applications
* Exposing values as a Prometheus exporter (creates a HTTP server)
* Provided systemd service file for easier integration as a system daemon
* Configurable refresh rate (e.g. to reduce CPU load)
* Optional posting of values also to Luftdaten or to InfluxDB

## Setup

We will be installing system prerequisites of Enviro boards and then installing this Python-based project.

But you most likely also need other components not provided by this project, like the Prometheus server and some way how to visualize gathered data. See section [External Components](#external-components).

### Prerequisites

* Python3
* installed system prerequisites of Pimoroni enviroplus-python library, including system reconfiguration
  * follow [pimoroni/enviroplus-python](https://github.com/pimoroni/enviroplus-python/#installing)

Note: exporter is tested with [Raspberry Pi OS](https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/), but as long as you provide access to sensor devices and system dependencies of Python libraries then feel free to use Debian/LXC/LXD/Docker/...

### Installation

We're going to run the exporter as the user `enviro` in the directory `/home/enviro`. Adjust values as you wish or reuse existing user, but it is recommended to use a separate user for security reasons.

1. (as root) Create the user and adjust access right to sensor devices

    ```sh
    useradd -m -G dialout,i2c,gpio enviro
    ```

2. (as a user, switched by su from root) Clone and install the exporter

    ```sh
    su - enviro
    git clone https://github.com/terradolor/prometheus-enviro-exporter.git
    cd prometheus-enviro-exporter
    pip3 install --user -r requirements.txt
    exit
    ```

    * Tune setup by editing `systemd/prometheus-enviro-exporter.service`
      * If you use different user, group or directory ...
      * If you are an Enviro user or you would like to change parameters then adjust `ExecStart`. Call `python3 prometheus-enviro-exporter.py --help` to list all available arguments.

3. (as root) Install and start systemd service

    ```sh
    systemctl enable /home/enviro/prometheus-enviro-exporter/systemd/prometheus-enviro-exporter.service
    systemctl start prometheus-enviro-exporter
    systemctl status prometheus-enviro-exporter
    ```

    * Status should be reporting no errors or failures
    * Also exported values are available in HTTP browser after specifying address `http://<RPI_IP_address>:9848/metrics`

## External Components

Discussion of other components required for displaying long-term graphs ...

### Prometheus Server

Purpose of the Prometheus server is to periodically scrape this exporter by reading values from exposed HTTP server, saving the data and providing API for visualization.

Note: It is probably not the best idea to save Prometheus server data to RPI SD card because IO traffic might reduce SD card lifetime.
But feel free to use it as a test and later relocate the server storage to another device or relocate the entire server.

Prometheus installation:

* [Debian Wiki](https://wiki.debian.org/Prometheus)
* [Prometheus documentation](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/installation/)

To enable scraping of this exporter instance edit `/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml` and add IP address and port of the exporter to `targets` list.

E.g. create a new `job_name: enviro` in `scrape_configs` section as in the abbreviated example below (last three lines).

```yaml
...
scrape_configs:
  ...
  - job_name: node
    static_configs:
    - targets: ['localhost:9100']
  - job_name: enviro
    static_configs:
    - targets: ['<RPI_IP_address>:9848']
```

Note: List RPI IP address by calling `ip addr show`. Or use a domain name instead of an IP if you have one. Or simply use `localhost` if server is running on the same machine as the exporter.

### Visualization

Visualization of Enviro exporter values from Prometheus server DB:

* [Prometheus built-in graph browser](https://prometheus.io/docs/visualization/browser/) for manual queries
* [Prometheus Consoles](https://prometheus.io/docs/visualization/consoles/)
  * For enabling on Debian systems please check `/etc/prometheus/consoles/README.consoles`
* [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) or any other service visualization service with Prometheus support

**Note:** Currently there is no predefined Prometheus Console or Grafana template visualizing values generated by this exporter. So you have to create your own and share it with the community if you like.

## Docker

There is a Dockerfile available if you'd like to run as a docker container.

1. Build: `docker build -t prometheus-enviro-exporter .`
2. Run: `docker run -d prometheus-enviro-exporter -d -p 9848:9848 --device=/dev/i2c-1 --device=/dev/gpiomem --device=/dev/ttyAMA0 prometheus-enviro-exporter`

## Acknowledgements

This project was originally forked from [tijmenvandenbrink/enviroplus_exporter](https://github.com/tijmenvandenbrink/enviroplus_exporter) but code was significantly rewritten:

* metrics have different names and values (so it is not compatible with original)
* new metrics are added
* new features like reduced and constant refresh rate
* changes in algorithms and fixes

Code is also using following projects:

* [pimoroni/enviroplus-python](https://github.com/pimoroni/enviroplus-python)
* [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/)
